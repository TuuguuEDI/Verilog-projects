This repository is for **Verilog Codes and Projects** and i will try to update every now and then.

## What is Verilog?

Verilog is a Hardware Description Language; a textual format for describing electronic circuits and systems. Applied to electronic design, Verilog is intended to be used for verification through simulation, for timing analysis, for test analysis (testability analysis and fault grading) and for logic synthesis.

## Board used 

The Basys 3 is an entry-level FPGA development board designed exclusively for the Vivado® Design Suite featuring the Xilinx® Artix®-7-FPGA architecture. Basys 3 is the newest addition to the popular Basys line of FPGA development boards for students or beginners just getting started with FPGA technology.
